  name: ComputerDefaults.exe - Upon execution, ComputerDefaults.exe checks two registry
    values at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\ms-settings\Shell\open\command; if
    these are set by an attacker, the set command will be executed as a high-integrity
    process without a UAC prompt being displayed to the user. See 'resources' for
    which registry keys/values to set.
