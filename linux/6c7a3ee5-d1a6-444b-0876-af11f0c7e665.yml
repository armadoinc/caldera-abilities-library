- description: 'An Adversary may set the bash history files size environment variable
    (HISTFILESIZE) to zero to prevent the logging of commands to the history file
    after they log out of the system.


    Note: we don''t wish to log out, so we are just confirming the value of HISTFILESIZE.
    In this test we 1. echo HISTFILESIZE 2. set it to zero 3. confirm that HISTFILESIZE
    is set to zero.
