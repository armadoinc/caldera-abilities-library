  name: Eventvwr.exe - During startup, eventvwr.exe checks the registry value HKCU\Software\Classes\mscfile\shell\open\command
    for the location of mmc.exe, which is used to open the eventvwr.msc saved console
    file. If the location of another binary or script is added to this registry value,
    it will be executed as a high-integrity process without a UAC prompt being displayed
    to the user.
