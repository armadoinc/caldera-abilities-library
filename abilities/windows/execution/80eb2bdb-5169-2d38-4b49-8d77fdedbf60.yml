  name: wbemtest.exe - Execute arbitary commands through WMI through a GUI managment
    interface for Web Based Enterprise Management testing (WBEM). Uses WMI to Create
    and instance of a Win32_Process WMI class with a commandline argument of the target
    command to spawn. Spawns a GUI so it requires interactive access. For a demo,
    see link to blog in resources.
